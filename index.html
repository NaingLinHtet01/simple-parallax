            <p>Bagan's history dates back to the 2nd century AD, but its prominence rose significantly between the 9th and 13th centuries when it became the heart of the Pagan Kingdom. This era marked a golden age for Burmese culture, religion, and architecture. The kingdom's rulers, including King Anawrahta, who is credited with founding the Bagan Empire in 1044, constructed numerous temples and monuments, many of which still stand today.</p>
